# Terraform AWS Multi-Environment Deployment with Terraform Cloud

This guide will walk you through setting up multiple environments (`dev`, `qa`, `prod`) using Terraform Cloud and deploying your AWS infrastructure across these environments. We'll create workspaces, configure AWS credentials in Terraform Cloud, and deploy the infrastructure step by step.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use Terraform Cloud for deploying AWS infrastructure across different environments: `dev`, `qa`, and `prod`. Each environment is isolated using Terraform workspaces, allowing for cleaner infrastructure management and safe deployments across different stages of development.

You will:
1. Create Terraform Cloud workspaces for different environments.
2. Set up AWS credentials for secure resource provisioning.
3. Use Terraform CLI and Terraform Cloud to manage infrastructure across multiple environments.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. [Terraform CLI](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed on your local machine.
2. A [Terraform Cloud](https://app.terraform.io) account.
3. AWS credentials (Access Key, Secret Access Key) with the necessary permissions to create AWS resources.
4. Basic knowledge of Terraform and AWS resource provisioning.

---

## Steps to Implement

### Step 1: Create Workspaces in Terraform Cloud

Log in to your [Terraform Cloud](https://app.terraform.io) account and create three separate workspaces:

1. `dev`
2. `qa`
3. `prod`

### How to Create Workspaces:
1. Go to your organization.
2. Navigate to the "Workspaces" tab.
3. Click on **Create a new workspace**.
4. Name the workspaces `dev`, `qa`, and `prod`.

---

### Step 2: Add AWS Credentials as Variables in Terraform Cloud

For each workspace (`dev`, `qa`, `prod`), add your AWS credentials.

1. Go to the workspace.
2. Click on **Variables**.
3. Add the following environment variables under the "Environment Variables" section:
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
   - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

Be sure to check the **Sensitive** checkbox when adding secret values to protect sensitive information.

---

### Step 3: Set Up Terraform Cloud Token Locally

1. Log in to your Terraform Cloud account via the CLI by running:
    ```bash
    terraform login
    ```

2. Enter your Terraform Cloud token when prompted. You can find this token in your Terraform Cloud account under **User Settings > Tokens**.

3. **Set your environment variable for the workspace**. Start with `dev`:
    ```bash
    export TF_WORKSPACE=dev
    ```

---

### Step 4: Initialize and Apply Terraform Configuration

#### Initialize Terraform:
Run the following commands to initialize the configuration for the `dev` environment:

```bash
terraform init
```
#### Validate the infrastructure:
Validate the infrastructure in the `dev` workspace:

```bash
terraform validate
```

#### Plan and Apply:
Generate a plan and deploy the infrastructure in the `dev` workspace:

```bash
terraform plan -out=tfplan
terraform apply -auto-approve tfplan
```

#### Check Application:
After a successful deployment, check the application by inspecting the output for the ALB DNS name:

```
alb_dns_name: "app-loadbalancer-16052524787.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com"
```

---

### Step 5: Switch to Another Workspace and Deploy

After deploying the `dev` environment, switch to `qa` and `prod` workspaces and repeat the process.

#### Switch to `qa` Workspace:
```bash
export TF_WORKSPACE=qa
```

#### Do same for other QA and PROD environment:
  - `Goto: Step 4`
  - `Repeat it`

## Step 6: Destroy the Infrastructure

To clean up and destroy the resources in each environment, follow the steps below:

#### Destroy in `dev`:
```bash
export TF_WORKSPACE=dev
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

#### Destroy in `qa`:
```bash
export TF_WORKSPACE=qa
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

#### Destroy in `prod`:
```bash
export TF_WORKSPACE=prod
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Workspace Issues
- **Error: Missing workspace mapping strategy**: If you encounter an error related to workspaces, ensure that you've correctly set the `TF_WORKSPACE` environment variable before running any Terraform commands.

### 2. AWS Credential Errors
- **Error: Invalid AWS credentials**: Verify that the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are correctly set in the Terraform Cloud workspace's environment variables section.

### 3. Terraform Cloud Authentication
- **Error: Terraform Cloud login failed**: Ensure that you've logged into Terraform Cloud using the CLI (`terraform login`) and have the correct API token configured.

## Donâ€™t Forget to Delete Everything After Testing

Oh, and letâ€™s not forget the golden rule of cloud cost managementâ€”make sure to delete all your AWS resources after testing. Unless, of course, you absolutely adore seeing unexpected charges on your bill ðŸ’¸. After all, who doesnâ€™t love a little surprise at the end of the month, right? ðŸŽ‰ 

Just remember, the cloud is not your personal storage locker; every resource comes with a price tag. Your wallet will thank you for the clean-up! So, go ahead and run those commands to destroy everything like itâ€™s your job:

#### Destroy Resources in All Environments:
```bash
export TF_WORKSPACE=dev && terraform destroy -auto-approve
export TF_WORKSPACE=qa && terraform destroy -auto-approve
export TF_WORKSPACE=prod && terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

And once the infrastructure is all gone, feel free to manually delete those Terraform workspaces from Terraform Cloudâ€”because who wouldnâ€™t want to double-check that everything is truly obliterated? Happy deleting! ðŸ§¹

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you've successfully deployed and managed AWS resources across multiple environments using Terraform Cloud. Youâ€™ve also learned how to handle workspaces, manage AWS credentials, and automate infrastructure provisioning with Terraform.
